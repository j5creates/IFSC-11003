             Project Revision and Reflection
            <p>************************************</p>
            For my first attempt at the web design project, I aaked my friends to review my work and provide feeback on both the design and content.
            Based on thier suggestions, I made the very known mistake of not having a contact page. Also my friends mentioned that the FAQ was reallu nice and simple. They felt like the navigation was easy to use and the color scheme was fitting for the topic of water.
            Some changes that I made was adding a contact page to allow users to reach out for more information. I also revised the faq page because the the "Q?" was too much and I decided to go simple and clean. Also working on this project has been a very valuable experience.
             One of the many things that I did well was my html structure which made it simpler to style with some css. 
            I also gain the confidence to keep on learning new tricks and skills to improve my web design skills. Receiving feedback from peers also helped me see things from a different perspective and improve my work.
             It is also a way to see that there is always room for improvement esspecially in the field of web design. Overall, this project has helped me grow and develop my skills and I look forward to applying what I've learned and continue to improve and make the best of my web design skills.
             <p></p>
              If I were to start over again, I would spend more time trying to plan the layout and the structure of the website before even thinking about the content. This would help me have a clear vision of what the code should look like and how to organize the content. Also it would would help me save time on revisions and edits.
              I would also try to explore more design options and color schemes to make the website more visually appealing toward the intended audience instead of just picking out what I think looks good.
              I would also test the website more thouroughly on different a different device and see how it would function on a different screen size. Overall, planning and testing are key aspects that I would focus on more if I were to start over again.

            </p>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement
            <p>*************************************</p>
            I believe With the idea of progressive enhancement. I believe that it is important it is forst to focus on the content and functionality of a website before worrying about the design and other cool features.
            I believing starting with a basic version of a website and then gradually adding more features is a great wayy to make a website known. For example google was never always the visually appealing search engine that we know today. It started off simple and basic and then over time is now one of the most popular search engines in the world.
             Also a webist that has done the same is youtube. 
            At first it started off as a simple video sharing platform and now it has evolved into a a major platform for many creators and buisniesses. I also like the idea of bulding a website ao that the content and functionally are available to all users regardless of their device or browser.
            It makes me wonder about how the experience would be and not just how it looks. I think progressive enhancement is a great approach to web design and is practical for creating accessible and user-friendly websites. Lastly, Progressive enhancement is very important because users feel heard when a website priotizes accessibility and more usability which allows many more people to access the content.
