            Dragon Project Revision and Reflection
            <p>************************************</p>
            For my first attempt at the web design project, I aaked my friends to review my work and provide feeback on both the design and content.
            Based on thier suggestions, I made the very known mistake of not having a contact page. Also my friends mentioned that the FAQ was reallu nice and simple. They felt like the navigation was easy to use and the color scheme was fitting for the topic of water.
            Some changes that I made was adding a contact page to allow users to reach out for more information. I also revised the faq page because the the "Q?" was too much and I decided to go simple and clean. Also working on this project has been a very valuable experience.
             One of the many things that I did well was my html structure which made it simpler to style with some css. 
            I also gain the confidence to keep on learning new tricks and skills to improve my web design skills. Receiving feedback from peers also helped me see things from a different perspective and improve my work.
             It is also a way to see that there is always room for improvement esspecially in the field of web design. Overall, this project has helped me grow and develop my skills and I look forward to applying what I've learned and continue to improve and make the best of my web design skills.
